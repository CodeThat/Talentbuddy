Student progress

Students are graded for their activity in each lab session.

It is expected that a studentâ€™s performance improves in time, which means that he should always receive a grade equal to or higher than the grade he received in the previous lab.

Given an array with the lab grades of a student

Your task is to

    write a function that checks whether the grades received by each student are in ascending order
    your function must print to standard output (stdout):
        1 if the grades are in ascending order (e.g. 1, 3, 3, 7)
        0 if the grades are not in ascending order (e.g. 1, 3, 7, 3)

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:

    grades
        which is an array containing the grades of the student

Data constraints

    the length of the array given as input will not exceed 1000 elements
